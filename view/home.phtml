								<p class="text-justify">Brimstone Haunted Hayride was founded on the heels of Springboro Haunted Hayride's closing. The producers of the <a href="http://www.renfestival.com/" class="subtle-link" target="_blank">Ohio Renaissance Festival</a> and <a href="http://www.celticfestohio.com/" class="subtle-link" target="_blank">Celtic Fest Ohio</a> along with the core management team from the old Springboro Haunted Hayride came together to keep a longstanding, fall tradition alive. Brimstone Haunted Hayride is located within Renaissance Park in Warren County, Ohio. The park's collection of unmarked graves provide some of their own hauntings to go along with the hayride's scares. The haunt pulls in many familiar themes while also kicking things up a notch with some brand new haunt experiences.</p>
								<p class="text-justify">The original Springboro Haunted Hayride opened in 1989 and was run on the Poff family farm. In 2002, the farm and Hayride were sold to the Danishek's who continued to operate the Hayride on what became Bull Run Farm. In 2004 the Black Bog was added as a second haunted attraction and over the next 12 years both the Bog and the Hayride grew and became more elaborate offering new and unique scares year after year. In 2015, the Springboro Haunted Hayride added fully automated audio systems to each wagon. These systems would automatically transition through soundtracks and audio effects as the wagon traveled through scenes. It was one of the first systems of its kind and provided a uniquely immersive haunt experience. In 2016 Springboro Haunted Hayride was slated to be closed for good. You can read <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="subtle-link" onclick="pages['home'].openFarewellLetter();">The Danishek's Farewell Letter</a> which was posted to the public before the last weekend of the 2016 season. In the early days of 2017, a deal was struck to revive the southwest Ohio hayride tradition just 10 minutes down the road as Brimstone Haunted Hayride.</p>
